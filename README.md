# My neovim configuration.

Mainly built from the amazing [neovim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) with accompanying [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ). From [ChristianChiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli)

As per the words of [adamhjk](https://github.com/adamhjk).

Thanks to all plugin authors.

Configuration uses Lua, see ``init.lua``
Plugins used are found in the file ``lua/user/plugins.lua`` file.
In a nutshell, [coq](https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim) for completion, [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for finding things, [chadtree](https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree) for a file explorer, and more.

Convention from [neovim from scratch](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch) are used. Having all configuration files in a ``user`` (name can be changed) acts as a namespace and prevents conflicts.
